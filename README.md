This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Running on Local Development Server

## Running Built Code
The easiest way to run the project is to use the development server.  To run the bundled public code the instructions for [running a static server](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#static-server) from the Create React App guide can be followed.

`npm install -g serve`
`serve -s build`
